### E-commerce system
This system was built with PHP, MySQL, and for FrontEnd side, HTML/CSS and JS for AJAX requests and some frontend magic :)

If you want to test this system, first of all, you need to have PHP and MySQL installed on your system

After that, you can change in config file credentials for DB. Also, you can change there some other params(for example, disable DEBUG mode, or set your template)
